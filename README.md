# SWAPI Vue Application

A Vue js application for displaying and searching through character details from the [SWAPI API](https://swapi.dev/).

<br />

This project uses Vuex for state management and is styled using Tailwind CSS.

## Next Steps

#### - Implement unit testing
Implementing unit testing will make the code easier to maintain and extend.

#### - Implement a fuzzy search
Fuzzy search approximately matches strings in a way which takes into account potential misspellings. Implementing this could improve the user experience by being more forgiving of misspellings in the user input.
